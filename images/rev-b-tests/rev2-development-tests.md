## Tests without the GPS module
The GPS module is hard to manually solder and especially desolder. Therefore, before assembling it, I wanted to make sure that all the circuits works as expected.

### Power supply

Tests with no load were done with all the parts assembled except GPS module.

#### Ripple without load

According to the datasheet, at light load currents, the device operates in power save mode and the output voltage ripple is independent of the output capacitor value. The output voltage ripple is set by the internal comparator thresholds. The typical output voltage ripple is 1% of the output voltage Vo, therefore we'd expect ripple of 33mVpp.

### Line regulation

The DC-DC converter was tested with a load of 70 Ohm consisting of a 68 Ohm resistor and 2 Ohm internal resistance of the ammeter.

Test conditions | Vin, V | Iin, mA | Vout, V | Iout, mA | Efficiency, %
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Vin = 4.5V, RL=70 Ohm | 4.498 | 36.59 | 3.3431 | 46.60 | 94.65%
Vin = 5.0V, RL=70 Ohm | 5.004 | 34.23 | 3.3434 | 47.90 | 93.49%
Vin = 5.5V, RL=70 Ohm | 5.503 | 31.66 | 3.3426 | 48.40 | 92.86%

### Load regulation

Load regulation was tested with three load currents: 5mA, 50mA and 100mA. It was difficult to get precise currents because fixed resistors were used as loads.

Test conditions | Vin, V | Iin, mA | Vout, V | Iout, mA | Efficiency, %
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Vin = 5.0V, RL=682 Ohm | 5.0099 | 3.59 | 3.3407 | 5.00 | 92.77%
Vin = 5.0V, RL=70 Ohm | 5.0039 | 34.58 | 3.3434 | 48.50 | 93.71%
Vin = 5.0V, RL=35 Ohm | 5.0043 | 67.09 | 3.3107 | 94.50 | 93.19%

### Dynamic Load

Dynamic load was tested with a fixed resistors, switched by a MOSFET. Switching frequency was 1kHz with duty cycle of 50%. A sense resistor of 1 Ohm was used to monitor the load current.

There are spikes of approx. 200mV when the load current changes from 4.6mA to almost 100mA. Similar spikes can are shown in the datasheet of TPS62203.

![Wavewform](017.png)

#### Results and conclusions

At first the output capacitor was a Samsung CL10A106KP8NNNC 10uF 0603 capacitor. The ripple at light load was 37mVpp and the ripple at 100mA load was 76mVpp. After changing the capacitor to Samsung CL21A226MPCLRNC 22uF 10V 0805 the ripple became 27.2mVpp and 18mVpp which is acceptable for this design.

Ripple at low currents (15-40mA) reaches 50mV which is relatively high but the GPS module has a built-in LDO which is supposed to be able to deal with it.

According to the datasheet of the ORG1411 GPS, it can have inrush current of up to 100mA for about 20Î¼s. Maximum steady-state current is 47mA during acquisition. The power supply used in this project will be able to supply these currents to the GPS module.

#### Output enable

Output enable circuit works as a latch. After WAKEUP becomes HIGH, the latch is triggered by the first UART TX LOW-HIGH transition and the AND gate output becomes HIGH. In this state, resistor R5 pulls the B input of the AND gate up independently of the UART TX level. When WAKEUP changes to LOW, the gate output level becomes to LOW too. In this state HIGH level on UART TX is unable to change the output level of the AND gate.

#### Power consumption

After wake-up, the GPS module enters the acquisition state and consumes around 60mA. Then, after 6-7 minutes, when tested inside a building, it enters the tracking state and consumes around 30mA. When it is turned of by toggling the ON_OFF pin, it consumes less than 100uA.

The circuit with all the additional components consumes 43-47mA in acquisition mode after wake-up, 23-25mA in the tracking mode and 40uA when the GPS is turned off. In the tracking mode after the position is acquired, current consumption doesn't change much and remains in the range of 20-25mA.

**Input current after wake-up**

![Wavewform](042.png)

Here we see that during the first 60 seconds the circuit is in the off mode and the input current is at its minimum of ~40uA. Then, during approx. 6 minutes, the circuit consumes ~40-45mA. Then, it is turned off and consumes ~40uA again.

**Input current after turning the circuit off and on again**

![Wavewform](043.png)

Here we see the circuit start-up after it was turned on, turned off and turned on again. The acquisition state lasts approximately 20 seconds. Almost immediately after the power-on, the module enters the tracking state and the circuit consumes ~25mA.

## Tests with the camera

The next step was to test the circuit connected to my Nikon D610. The camera supplies voltage of 5-6V depending on the load current.

### Input voltage ripple

The aim of these tests is to measure the ripple voltage on the input voltage which comes from the camera.

#### GPS off

Input ripple when the GPS module is in hibernate state. In this state it consumes ~40uA and switching frequency of the buck converter is very low. Measured input voltage is 5.909V.

**CH1:** | 5V (TP1)

#### GPS in acquisition mode

In this mode the circuit draws ~47mA from the source. Measured input voltage is 5.695V.

**CH1:** | 5V (TP1)

#### GPS in tracing mode

In this mode the circuit draws ~25mA from the source. Measured input voltage is 5.720V.

**CH1:** | 5V (TP1)

#### Reducing input ripples

These ripple voltages look high. They depend on the value of C5 which is currently 4.7uF. Its footprint is 0805 and the highest 0805 capacitor I have is 22uF (Samsung CL21A226MPCLRNC). The following screenshots show the input ripples after increasing C5.

**GPS off**

**Tracking mode**

--- | ---
**CH1:** | 5V (TP1)

Increasing C5 lowered the ripples by approximately 50%.

#### Ripple on the GPS module

Ripple voltages on the GPS module (U1 pin 4) were too high: 43.2mVpp, 56mvpp and 49.6mVpp in hibernate, acquisition and tracking mode accordingly. I had to increase the value of C1 to 22uF in order to reduce the ripple voltage.

**GPS off**

![Wavewform](050.png)

The ripple is ~13mVpp not including the small spikes.

**Acquisition mode**

![Wavewform](051.png)

**Tracking mode**

In the tracking mode the current of the GPS module changes many times per second. It can be seen on the amplitude and frequency of the ripple voltage. During the time of high current consumption the ripple falls to ~15mVpp and when the GPS current is low, the ripple can reach ~50mVpp. The GPS module has an internal LDO which should be able to deal with such ripple.

### GPS on and off

When nothing is connected to the camera, the voltage on the UART pin of the GPS connector is 2.7V. In order to prevent possible overload, I changed R6 from 33 Ohm to 300 Ohm.
