# Development tests of DIY GPS for Nikon DSLR

## Test equipment

1. Siglent SDS1204X-E oscilloscope
2. GOPHET CPS-3205 II power supply
3. UNI-T UT61E DMM
4. Siglent SDG1032X signal generator

## Tested Circuit

## Tests without the GPS module
The GPS module is hard to manually solder and especially desolder. Thus, before assembling it, I wanted to make sure that the circuit works as expected.
